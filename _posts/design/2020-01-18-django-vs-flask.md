Hello there. Many of you are trying to learn back-end developing and there are many confusions about whether I should lean this or that. There are a lot of web programming languages or frameworks you can learn, such as PHP, Django, Flask, node, etc. Today, I'll focus just on Django and Flask and I think I'll be able to wipe out all the confusion about these two web frameworks.

First of all, we have to know some basic things about them. Django and Flask are two web frameworks. Both of them are python frameworks, they use python in their background. You can make almost everything in the web developing field with any of them. But they are slightly different. Sometimes it's good to use Django, sometimes Flask. Let's talk about the pros and cons of Django and Flask in different aspects. 

### Framework:

As I said earlier, Django is a full-stack web developing python framework. Django allows you to code some common web developing tasks, like user authentication, URL formatting, database connecting, etc. You can make different kinds of apps and manage them easily because the whole framework is well organized. On the other hand, Flask is a minimalistic web framework. It's simple and lightweight. There are a lot of builtin features in Django where you'll not find a lot in Flask. 

### Template: 

Flask uses jinja2 as its template engine. It's a fully-featured template engine in python and it's quite easy to read and handle. That's cool. On the other hand, Django uses it's own template engine called DTL(Django Template Language) which is fully dedicated to Django. Since it's made for Django, web developers don't need to put more time and effort to learn something new. It's builtin. 

### Admin Panel: 

Django comes with a default administration panel which is quite cool. You can handle all the admin panel stuff there. You can manage posts and other apps and user authentications there. Which is very satisfying. Unlike Django, Flask has no builtin Admin panel. So you are not getting any kinds of extra benefits from Flask. 

### Tools: 

Django has some builtin tools, like bootstrapping tool, `django-admin`. It enables you to start building web applications without any external data. It also allows you to divide  a task into smaller tasks and manage them easily. On the other hand, Flask doesn't have any bootstrapping tool, it's just a minimalistic web framework with no big modules. 

### Speed: 

Though Django and Flask use the same programming language, python, Django is a little bit slower than Flask. Because Django has to maintain a lot of advanced stuff But Flask doesn't have any fancy heavy modules. Its minimalistic structure gives it some speed. 

### Entire Layout

As always, Django comes with some heavy project structure with a lot of features and Flask is a minimal framework. Flask only allows you to write everything in a single application. But in Django, you can use multiple applications into one web project. So you can handle those applications separately and integrate them easily. So in a huge project, Django always has a upper hand. 

### Database availability

Django allows developers to take advantage of the ORM system. For this, we can use almost every database like MySQL, Oracle, SQlite, Postgresql and so on. On the other hand, Flask doesn't provide any ORM and you have to use SQLALChemy as a SQL toolkit. 

### Flexibility

Django gives you a lot of third-party tools and libraries to create various web applications. You can make almost anything with Django. But sometimes you can't change a lot of builtin things. Though Flask a micro web framework, it has a huge library too. The development tools for Flask are so easy to understand, beginners can use them too. It's somehow more flexible than Django. 

### Use cases

Both of them are currently used in various high-traffic websites. But the statistics show that Django is more popular than Flask. I also searched for some freelancing community about the availability of work in Django and Flask and Django has more Job opportunities than Flask. 

### Community

Both of them have a decent amount of users and both of them provide nice documentations. but the Django community is lot bigger than Flask, so if you face any problem in Django, you can find a lot more help than Flask. So Flask has a slight disadvantage. 

Overall, both of them have some pros and cons. The main thing is, you can learn any of them. If you are planning to make a small project, you can use Flask because it's faster. But if you want to make a project which will have some unique applications, I'll always suggest you use Django because it has a lot more options, modules, and builtin things than Flask. I think you have understood everything about Django and Flask. If you have a lot of time, I'll suggest you learn Django because you'll find a lot of opportunities to shine. Happy coding. Stay well. 

I'm giving you a video where you'll find some more stuff.
